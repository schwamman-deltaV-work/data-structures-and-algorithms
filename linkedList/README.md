# Singly Linked List
Implement a Singly Linked List Data Structure

## Challenge
- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

- Within your LinkedList class, include a head property. Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.

- Define a method called insert which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list with an O(1) Time performance.

- Define a method called includes which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.

- Define a method called toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.

## Approach & Efficiency
I created 2 classes, a Node class used to create new nodes and a LinkedList class with all required methods.
